    h2.lh-title Safeguarding at St Peter’s Church
    p.lh-copy We take the safeguarding and care of children and vulnerable adults very seriously at St Peter’s, Walworth. Our Parish Safeguarding Officers and Churchwardens can be contacted on the phone numbers below. Keeping children, young people and all vulnerable adults safe in church is everyone’s responsibility. On this page you will find details of who you can contact if you are worried that someone is being abused, neglected, treated badly, or in danger.

    p.lh-copy If a child or adult tells you that someone has hurt them in any way (emotionally, physically, sexually) or that they feel unsafe, this must be taken seriously straight away. Our safeguarding response is only as good and strong as the first response when someone feels vulnerable or unsafe.
    p.lh-copy The wellbeing (shalom) of any person who feels vulnerable (child or adult) must always be held paramount, no matter how uncomfortable that may be, because only then can we create a church that is safer for everyone. No-one is beyond reproach: clergy, PSOs, parents, carers, teachers: no-one! If you have a worry that someone is harming another person, you must do something about it, no matter who is involved.
    p.lh-copy Please see #[a(href="https://href.li/?https://southwark.anglican.org/safeguarding/diocesan-policies-and-procedures" target="_Blank") A Safe Church] for our safeguarding policies which come from the Diocese of Southwark. Each year, we hold a Safeguarding Sunday at the end of September to help the whole church family at St Peter’s, young and old in age-appropriate ways, be more aware of the need to keep everyone as safe as possible in church: we want everyone to be able to worship, to flourish in church and to follow their God-given vocation.
    p.lh-copy If you have concerns that someone in church is not safe, or if you have seen something that you think is not right, please speak to one of our Safeguarding Team or the Churchwardens below:
