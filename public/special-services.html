If you live in our parish <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.achurchnearyou.com/" target="_Blank">(check here)</a> you are entitled to be baptised (christened) <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.churchofengland.org/weddings-baptisms-funerals/baptism/christening-faqs.aspx">here</a>, or have your child baptised here. There is some helpful information here. At St Peter‚Äôs, Baptism takes place during the Parish Mass in order to follow the tradition and rules of the Church, and so that the whole Church family is present to welcome the candidates, and surround them with prayer and love. Candidates (adults or children) also receive preparation from the clergy to help them get ready to make this Christian commitment. (This is according to Church Law: Canon B21).</p><h3 class="lh-title">Marriages</h3><p class="lh-copy">In addition to those who live in the parish, you may also be entitled to be married at St Peter‚Äôs if you or your parents grew up or lived here previously, or if you currently (or previously) attended Mass regularly at St Peter‚Äôs. Helpful information <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.yourchurchwedding.org/">here</a>. Sadly, while St Peter‚Äôs, Walworth believes in the full dignity and equality of all God‚Äôs children, we are only able to hold services of blessing for same-sex couples for now - we love to do this, and would love to work with you to prepare a service in church to celebrate your civil marriage. Alongside this, we are working to achieve justice and equal marriage in the Church of England.</p><h3 class="lh-title">Funerals</h3><p class="lh-copy">If you live in the parish and have sadly lost a loved one, please contact the clergy via the parish office on <a href="tel:02077033139">020 7703 3139</a>. We can then give you pastoral support and help you begin to prepare for the funeral here in church or at a crematorium or cemetery.</p><p class="lh-copy">There are also many other special times in life when a church service may be appropriate: the birth of a child, a special anniversary. Please be in touch if you would like to come and give thanks to God and pray for God‚Äôs blessing around a special time.</p></main><footer class="bg-blue white cf pa3" id="footer"><address class="fl w-100 w-50-m w-third-l mb3"><h4 class="mt0">Parish Church</h4><p class="ma0">St Peter's Church Walworth<br />Liverpool Grove<br />London<br />SE17 2HH<br /></p><a class="link white mv2 dib" href="tel:02077033139">‚òéÔ∏è 020 7703 3139</a><br /><a class="link white dib" href="mailto:office@stpeterswalworth.org">üìß office@stpeterswalworth.org</a></address><article class="fl w-100 w-50-m w-third-l mb3"><h4 class="mt0">Parish Office </h4><dl> <dt>Parish Administrator </dt><dd class="pa1">Mrs Catherine Attride</dd><dt>Rector </dt><dd class="pa1">Father Andrew Moughtin-‚ÄãMumby</dd><dt>Parish Office Opening times </dt><dd class="pa1">Between 10.00am to 1.00am, Tuesday to Friday</dd></dl></article><section class="fl w-100 w-100-m w-third-l flex flex-column justify-center items-center"><a class="dib bg-white blue pa3 br3 tc link" href="https://href.li/?http://eepurl.com/u4xff" target="_Blank">Subscribe to our newsletter</a></section></footer></body></html>
